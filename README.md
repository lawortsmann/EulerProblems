# EulerProblems
NOTE:
Most of these solutions are in Mathematica
number 501 takes an unreasonably long time to run (on my laptop), but after a couple minutes,
  it will output the correct answer.

The python files evolutionary.py and rune.py are an attepmt (abet failed attempt) to solve problem number XXX via
  brute force; however, under my testing, I never got the correct answer. However, the algorthim did converge to
  a set of values with an error factor of 10^-11. Close, but appearently not close enough.
